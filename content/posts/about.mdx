Art Club, HKUSU aims at creating an artistic and diverse community for HKU members. Here, you can secretly take a rest from your busy life. You can also enjoy the time of making your own masterpieces through various art-related workshops and events, such as art fair, painting and DIY production workshops. Given a series of seminars, one of them must be your favorite. Therefore, no matter whether you are good at art or not, we welcome you to have fun with us! We hope that we can arouse your enthusiasm for art. We look forward to meeting you in the art studio!

“Iridescence” is defined as bright, luminous, multi-colored hues that shift and transform upon being viewed from different angles.To us, the multi-colored, rainbow-like nature of “iridescence” represents diversity and open-mindedness and connotes our ability, as humans to adapt and change. We intend for the art studio to be a constant, reliable environment that can bring a sense of normality, stability, and comfort amidst our chaotic world. At Art Club, HKU, therefore, we hope to uphold, enlighten and bring out the attributes of “iridescence” in all of our members.
